I have reached the point of having most of my desired set-up completed. I am able to run an Xsession on the PiZero hooked up to my living room display, which in turn runs a view-only VNC client; this connects to the VNC server running on my desktop. I also have the bluetooth connection on my desktop working seemingly our of the box (I had thought that there needed to be some additional configuration to have it startup automatically).

Now the only real remaining issues are the latency of the display. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a great remedy for this. If I'm only manipulating the mouse and keyboard and doing some browsing it's not too bad, but if I want to watch a video it becomes pretty much useless. Were I to play a video game I think it would be unplayable.

Not to worry thought; I've come this far, and found solutions to more problems than just this.

Another thing that I've been working on has been setting up crontabs. I'm using fcron specifically, which isn't that much different from normal cron. The purpose of crontabs is to specify a date and time for a given command to be executed.

In my case I am mostly concerned about running jobs on system startup, such as a virus scan; on an hourly basis, such as the synchronization of my Nextcloud files; on a daily basis, such as the synchronization of my Github files; and on a weekly basis, such as system back-ups and updates.
