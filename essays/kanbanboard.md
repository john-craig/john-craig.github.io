A kanban board is a great tool for tracking the status of tasks involved in a project across an entire team. But there are two words in that sentence I want to discuss: **team** and **tracking**.

At a team level kanban boards are very effective because they allow each team member to quickly see what the other members have made progress on at a glance. They also allow a project manager to see the progress of the project overall.

At an individual level, however, the kanban board is just a minor piece of tedium. In a software development project a programmer already has to deal with writing Git commit messages and getting reviews on their merge requests. Along with, obviously, the actual programming effort, whatever it may be.

**While kanbans are effective for teams, updating them is a chore for an individual.**

Kanban boards are also very useful for tracking the tasks that make up a project. Cards in a board may be assigned to team members, given due dates, and marked to indicate dependency on other cards. Thus a board, assuming it is updated and managed well, can give effective estimates of how much of the project is left to be completed at any given time.

But how does one actually get to the cards? One might try to simply add each item on the list of project requirements as a card, but this will not go very far. The verbal descriptions of a requirement rarely translate well into the technical demands they entail.
