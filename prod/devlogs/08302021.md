Figured out the issue with the API endpoints-- needed to add CORS to the Flask app, now everything is working more or less correctly. For some reason I'm needing to use `.then` to get the response from a fetch request even though it was already `await`'d, so that's a little odd.

Man I need to figure out how to echo newlines into files.

Okay, so with a bit of work I'm up to the point of being able to POST a new agenda item to the back-end. I don't entirely have it working yet-- it's supposed to return the ID of the newly created database record after the POST-- but, it also appears that the `queueList` function isn't returning its contents correct either.

Honestly I'm having more and more of a reason to try switching to a JSON-oriented database rather than SQL... since I don't really need a relational database for this application, unless I were to decide to include a feature for linking individual tasks to larger projects.

Nuthin'.
