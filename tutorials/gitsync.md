As a developer, the temptation to spend three hours automating a task that takes thirty seconds is constantly looming and ever-alluring. So, having giving into that temptation for synchronizing git repositories, I'm going to help you out a little.

```
url=$(git remote get-url origin)
token=$(cat $path/to/your/.git-token)

before="https://"
after="https://$token@"

url="${url/$before/$after}"

git pull origin main

git add .

git commit -m "Automated commit on `date`"

git push $url
```

This is a script I wrote to automate git commits. It will commit all changes in a repository and push it to the remote, with a commit message dated to that commit.

I'll explain what it does line by line.

`url=$(git remote get-url origin)`

This places the URL of the upstream git repository into a bash variable. That will look something like this: "https://github.com/user-name/repository.git"

`token=$(cat $path/to/your/.git-token)`

This reads the contents of a github access token into a bash file. You can get one of these by going to "Settings -> Developer -> Personal Access Token" on github. Needless to say you should be careful with where you keep these, and preferably use an SSH certificate instead.

`before="https://"`
`after="https://$token@"`
`url="${url/$before/$after}"`

This uses a little bit of bash replacement to turn the contents of the url from "https://github.com/user-name/repository.git" to "https://my-access-token@github.com/user-name/repository.git". This will be necessary for later.

`git pull origin main`
`git add .`
`git commit -m "Automated commit on `date`"`

Nothing revolutionary here. This pulls down the most recent changes from the main branch of the remote, adds all the local changes, and commits it with a message containing the system's date at that time.

`git push $url`

Here's where we needed that url. By including our access token in the repository target for the push, we can bypass the authentication prompts... or, more accurately, the authentication is included.
