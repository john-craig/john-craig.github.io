	Well I spent a little bit of time this weekend on the agenda manager. After some finnicking around I was able to have entries in a log document correctly completed, which was the main bug. Now hopefully I can just set it to run with a cron job and it will do its changes automatically, although there will inevitably be edge-cases and such that I need to manually add exception handling for.
	I suppose I could invest some time into creating testcases for this thing, and hopefully expose any error cases thereby. The issue is that I just don’t have the time for that; it’s difficult enough to make time for programming stuff outside of work as it is, and I have a whole backlog of projects that I want to move through, so spending a bunch of extra time fleshing out testcases for just one is a difficult proposition.
	The other thing I did was some nice ricing. As I mentioned last week, I sort of wiped out all the configuration files in my home directory, so I got to start fresh with the way everything looks. I use Urxvt for my terminal, which can be controlled by a .Xresources file, and there are plenty of repositories out there with custom themes to chose from.
	Other applications, like Atom, Joplin, Emacs, etc. are slightly trickier to add custom themes into, so I just went with some of the pre-packaged ones that looked good. Sort of the same issue I touched on above; there’s so much to get through that I don’t have the time to invest into any one thing, you know?
	But I’m hoping that this agenda manager will help with that. If I can break down all the little tasks that need to be completed into more manageable items and then allot them throughout week, I can sift through my pile of projects.
	That’s the hope, anyways.

	Not a lot done today; mostly poked around on my Nginx/Portainer setup to see if I could get the Bookstack service exposed properly. Looks like I’m going to need to figure out the situation with DNS resolution first.
	There seems to be a whole process where a service called DuckDNS gives you access to your own subdomain that Nginx can then host the webpage(s) for, however I’m not sure this is actually what I want. I just need to be able to access these services locally, I have no real need to go all the way out to the internet and then back to my home network when I’m connecting to them.
	I believe what I want is to just manually alter the DNS records for my DNS server, so that I get redirected without needing to even leave my network. Whether this defeats the purpose of Nginx I am not as certain about.

	As it turns out this thing I’m thinking of is a feature called “Conditional DNS Forwarding”, and it comes pre-packaged with PiHoles as per the most recent update, although there is a little bit of extra tinkering required to get it to work.
	Now, let’s take a step back and get straight exactly what is going on here. Nginx Proxy Manager is a service that will send connection requests meant for either an IP address or a URL to another destination, typically an IP address on the same device or in the same network. If I connect straight to the IP address which Nginx Proxy Manager is running on, it will connect me to the destination I have configured for it.

	So as it turns out I was partially correct. PiHoles do have a feature called Conditional DNS Forwarding, and they do require extra tinkering, but they do not really seem to do what I am looking for as far as I can tell. Instead of using Conditional DNS Forwarding, it is possible to specify a list of, essentially, host aliases inside of the configuration files of the PiHole which accomplishes the same thing, however.
	At least, I think that it’s essentially the same thing. It certainly succeeds in sending requests for the aliased URL to the IP address of the device, and I am able to see the default Nginx server page when I navigate to it in a browser, so I am chosing to take that as a good sign. Whether Nginx will be able to serve pages to subdomains of this URL, on the other hand, is something that I still have to sort of test out more.

	Well, once again I was partially correct. There is a file called “/etc/pihole/custom.list” where these aliases I mentioned can be specified, taking the format of “[IP Address] [Hostname [Hostname 2]..]”, and Pihole will redirect requests based on this specification. However for these purposes each Hostname is matched exactly.
	So, if I had an entry like “192.168.1.44 example.org”, Pihole would redirect only requests for “example.org”; not, “foo.example.org” or “bar.example.org”. Each these would need to be added manually to the entry. What I was in need of was a way to send requests for any subdomain under a certain domain to the IP I wanted.
	It turns out the way to do this is by going to “/etc/dnsmasq.d/” and adding a file called “05-custom.conf”. This directory can be used to configure dnsmasq directly, which is the software that Pihole uses for its DNS server. For this configuration the format is a little different, it takes the form of “address=/[Hostname]/[IP address]”.
	Here, a ‘.’ can be left in front of the hostname, such as “.example.org”, and it will cover all subdomains of that hostname. With this configuration anything like “foo.example.org” or “bar.example.org” or “baz.example.org” etc will be redirected.
	Okay, so what is all this actually used for?
	Supposed you wanted to setup your self-hosted services on your local network and you wanted to access them through the hostname “home.local”. All this configuration above makes it so that anytime a device on your network tries to connect to “home.local”, it will be sent to the IP address you specified. Here you will have some kind of server-- I am used a RaspberryPi-- which is running Nginx Proxy Manager.
	Nginx Proxy Manager, which has a pretty inuitive UI, can be set to display a webpage of your choice when a request is meant for a certain URL. So you could set it to display Portainer, a software for managing docker containers, on the URL “control.home.local”. You could, for that matter, have it display its admin panel at “proxy.home.local”.
